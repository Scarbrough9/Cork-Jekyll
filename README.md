# Cork Theme - Jekyll Edition

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) starter theme for developers. The theme includes/utilizes the following features, or opinions, if you want to look at it that way.

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [libSass](http://libsass.org/)
- [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)

Please note that all of this is not required to develop a Jekyll site locally, these tools simply offer a slightly opinionated, but fairly solid local development work flow. This documentation aims to provide some insight regarding the choices made while outlining how to get started.

## Requirements

1. First, you need to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by running:
``` gem install jekyll ```

2. Next, you need to make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) properly installed. There are several ways to do this, here are some opinions, I'll leave you to decide...
* [Installing Node and npm](https://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/)
