# Cork Theme - Jekyll Edition

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) starter theme for developers. The theme includes/utilizes the following features, or opinions, if you want to look at it that way.

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
- [libSass](http://libsass.org/)
- [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/)

Please note that all of this is not required to develop a Jekyll site locally, these tools simply offer a slightly opinionated, but fairly solid local development work flow. This documentation aims to provide some insight regarding the choices made while outlining how to get started.

## Getting Started

1. First, you need to install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) by running:
    ``` bash
    gem install jekyll 
    ```

2. Now you need to make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) properly installed. There are several ways to do this, here are some opinions, I'll leave you to decide...
    * [Installing Node and npm](https://www.joyent.com/blog/installing-node-and-npm/)
    * [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)
    * [How to Install Node.js and NPM on a Mac](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
    * [Installing Node.js](https://www.araport.org/docs/science-apps-configuring-development-environment/installing-nodejs)

3. Next, navigate to the directory where you want to keep the project, i.e., ` cd ~/Sites/Jekyll `. Now you can pull down the latest version of the theme. There are number of methods that you can choose to do this. I prefer to use the ` wget ` command. If you have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you can use the ` wget ` command after running ` brew install wget `.
