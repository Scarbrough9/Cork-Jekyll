        <p>This is the homepage of your starter theme, not to be confused with a Starter jacket. Starter jackets are gangster, as am I.</p>
        <p>In the sidebar, there are two examples of Jekyll includes put to use. One is a posts loop and the other is a weighted pages loop. The pages in this loop are sorted by weight which is assigned in each page's YAML Front Matter.</p>
