You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight php startinline=true %}
if($haters === $hate) {
    echo 'Haters gon hate';
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js startinline=true %}
gotJokes = function(str1, str2) {
    str1 = typeof str1 !== 'undefined' ? str1: "What kind of pants does Mario wear? ";
    str2 = typeof str2 !== 'undefined' ? str2: "Denim, Denim, Denim";
    var hahaha = str1.concat(str2);
    return hahaha;
};
{% endhighlight %}
